# Battlesnake Python Starter Project

**FINALIST**

A Battlesnake created in a one-day hackathon for the UVic Battlesnake 2023 tournament. This snake advanced through 5 rounds of free-for-all battles to reach the finals, where it suffered its defeat. Note the code has not been edited from what was done during the hackathon and thus is messy with lots of unfinished sections.
